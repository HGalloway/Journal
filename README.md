This program has helped me keep my idea's in one place.

On Windows:
Download the folder and run the exe.

On Linux:
Make setup.sh executable by using chmod +x setup.sh
Then just type ./setup.sh to execute
Then you can just type journal to execute the program.

I hope this program helps you as it has helped me.
Also please take a look at my source code. 
It would please me very much if it helped someone with their own code
